### Problem 1
_(2 points) How would you run a randomized controlled double-blind experiment to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine? Write down procedures for the experimenter to follow. (Maximum 200 words)_

__Solution:__ This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Write your answer in a brief and clear language. In addition, you should add all materials that you have consulted to in the Reference section at the end of the report.  These materials could be a paper [1], a book [2], or some internet materials [3].

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.height="30%"}

plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
